To run MPeat2D model

1. Put all file in the same folder.
2. Run the input data rain.m for the net rainfall rate and temperature.m for the annual air temperature. 
   Those data can be obtained from field measurements or simulation model.  
3. Run the main file MPeat2D.m. 
   Running time depend on the computer performance and  simulation time of the model.  

We provide the example of plotting the results through plotresult.m that requires the input data from xplot.m, yplot.m, and variableplot.m
